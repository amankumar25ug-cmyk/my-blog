# My First Step into the Tech World 

Hello everyone!\
Welcome to my first blog on GitHub.

My name is **Aman**, and I am a **BSc Information Science student at Azim Premji University, Bengaluru**. This blog is a small step in my learning journey, where I will share what I learn, build, and explore in the world of technology.

I am still a beginner, but I believe that learning in public helps us grow faster and stay motivated. This blog is not about being perfect — it is about being consistent.
